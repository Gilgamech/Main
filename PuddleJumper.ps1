Shit goes here

need to fix New-Module up with the new module stuff.

Plans:
1. Install itself
- Use common passwords.
2. Reset password, store that somewhere.
3. Resiliency to reboots?

1. Install itself, change admin pw, listen for more directions. 
2. If IIS/Apache/etc installed, adds random page to website.
